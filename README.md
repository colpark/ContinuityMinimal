# ContinuityMinimal

A minimal proof-of-concept exploring continuity-aware neural representations.

## Hypothesis

**Brain representation is a continuous stream.** To be robust to sparse sensing (sparse actions, sparse sensory inputs), neural network foundation models should be **continuity-aware**.

## Core Insight

The brain solves the same problem AI models face: reconstructing continuous experience from discrete, sparse signals. Buzsáki's multi-scale brain rhythms provide the biological mechanism—oscillations act as the "carrier of continuity" that binds discrete neural spikes into smooth trajectories.
